TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

- Check out the repo, 
- run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, 
- run `rake spec` to run the tests. 
- You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To release a new version, 
- update the version number in `version.rb`,
- update CHANGELOG.md
- push (commit) changes
- then run `bundle exec rake release`, 
    - which will create a git tag for the version, 
    - push git commits and tags, and 
    - push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

if gem does not push then run 
- gem push pkg/rubocop-publicdoc2-<new version>.gem
